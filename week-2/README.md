# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. It's specially made for Marie Driessche. She is deaf. To make it more usefull for her, I added some icons to my website so she doesn't have to read everything. I used a lot of white spacing, headings and not a lot of content, Because she wants to have a quick overview of the content, and not spend to much time on a website.

## Job stories
### Marie
- When I need to contact a company, I want to have multiple contact options on the website, so I can choice the right option for me
- When I visit a website that is not written in my first language, I want to have summarized content with not to much jargon, so I can understand the content easily
- When I watch video's online, I want to have (real) subtitles, so I can understand what they are saying.

### Owner of a potential agency
- When I am looking for a new employee, I want to have a quick overview from their work, so I can see what they have done.
- When I am looking for a new employee, I want to be able to look at their code, so I can see what their level is.
