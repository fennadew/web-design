# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. It's specially made for Marie Driessche. She is deaf. To make it more usefull for her, I added some icons to my website so she doesn't have to read everything. I used a lot of white spacing, headings and not a lot of content, Because she wants to have a quick overview of the content, and not spend to much time on a website.


## Table of Content
