# Web-design
For this course I have build a fake portfolio website. All images are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

## Getting started
Here is how to get started:
1. Download or clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/fennadew/web-design.git`
2. No need to install any dependencies! This is all you need.
  
## 3 Design Principles
### 1. Strong visual hierarchies work best
I have chosen this principle because this is one of the most important principles. This ensures that things are easier to read. You also know more quickly what things are for and what is more important. I have applied this principle by applying strong visual hierarchy to texts. For example, I chose a bold fontweight for all titles, and also a larger font size for the titles. For the normal text I have chosen a somewhat easier and lighter font-size so that it is easier to read.

The images on the website take a lot of attention. This is intended to view the images as the main goal of the website. After all, it is a portfolio.

### 2. Progressive disclosure
The home page has a purpose, namely to show photos. When the user chooses to learn more about the photographer, there is an action for this, but when this is clicked on, the user is separated from the rest of the website. This way your user knows where he is and also the consequences of his action. He can only see what had to do with that action. He can easily return to the overview to press the closing button.

### 3. Clarity is job #1
